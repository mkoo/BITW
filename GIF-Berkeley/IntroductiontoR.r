##R is a calculator (try your own!):
# run these lines in RStudio by either typing them in the console window or highlighting rows and pressing control+return keys 

555/66
2+3
#Respects laws of precedence
2+3*4
(2+3)*4
###
#Assigning variables: operator is "<-" OR "="
#R is case sensitive so q and  Q are different variables.
x <- 2

y = 3

z <- 5

x+y*z

result <- x+y*z

result

#Objects are stored in the workspace.
ls()       #see them all
rm(x)      #remove 'x'
ls()
#also this
objects()
#Add back 'x', RStudio makes that easy to do without typing the whole line again!

###       Vectors: creating vectors,  the functions c(), seq(), subsetting
xvec <- 1:5
xvec

yvec <-10:15
#see yvec

zvec <- c(10,17,12,8,5,1)
zvec

#    [] square brackets allows returning values by indexing
zvec[3]
yvec[2:4]
#     What happens when the index is out of range?
xvec[8]

#Subsetting vectors
zvec[c(5,1,2)]

zvec[(z==TRUE)]    #Use logical

# seq() function--generate sequential values
help(seq)
a <- seq(10,20)
a

a <- seq(20,10)
a

b <- seq(from=17,to=30,by=2)
b

b <- seq(17,30,2)
b

# Functions that work on vectors
sum(xvec)

mean(zvec)

yvec^2

yvec*10

length(xvec)

sum(xvec)/length(xvec)

#see how vectors can interact
table(xvec)
vec2 <- c(xvec,10,10,4)
vec2

table(vec2)

# Finding things in vectors: use comparison operators (==, <, >, <=, >=, !=), boolean operators ( |, & )and sum() function
vec2 == 1

sum(vec2 == 1)

vec2 == 10

sum(vec2 == 10)

vec2 > 1 & vec2 < 12 #Use & Boolean operator

length(vec2) #Very useful function for writing loops

#Check to see whether an object is a vector
is.vector(vec2)
#Convert an object to a vector
vec3 <- as.vector(vec2)

#Vectors can also be characters
n <- c("Turdus", "migratorius")

names(n) = c("Genus", "species")
n
#or reverse order
n[c("species", "Genus")]

###     Data Frames
#Data frames are for storing data tables, think of it as a list of vectors of equal length.

###     Matrices
#Matrices are arrays of 2 dimension arranged in columns and rows
#Creating with matrix() function
?matrix #see help for set of arguments
x <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3)
x
#how many rows and columns
dim(x)

#Converting Vector to Matrix
temp1 <- c(5,10,12,24,42,60,63,72)
temp2 <- c(8,1, 3, 88, 33, 0, 77, 42)

#cbind() -- Column Bind. Good for matrices, works with data frames but can cause problems
#each vector must be of same length.
mat <- cbind(temp1, temp2)
mat

is.matrix(mat)

#rbind() -- Row Bind, same logic as cbind but with rows. Each vector must be of same length.

mat2 <- rbind(temp1,temp2)
dim(mat2)

#Using indexes how would you get a specific value from a matrix?
mat2[2,4]  #2nd row, 4th element

#How would you find the first three values of the first row?
#your answer here:


mat2[,1:4] #All rows, but just columns 1 through 4 --very handy

#How would you add a new row of data?

#######
###    Lists   - useful data type that can be anything like numbers, character strings, matrices, other lists
#Lists may be a mix of data types
list = list(species="amphibians", country="US", count="297")
list[1:3]

#How would you call up individual elements? Say, only 'count'?

#Create another list
list2 = list(species="amphibians", country="MX", count="368")

#How would you append these lists together?
# Careful about trying to use as a vector as R will try to coerce to the same data type
#(either all numbers or all characters)

#Note in the Workspace what the data types are for the objects you created

###
#  cat() is really useful as it will write just about anything anywhere.
cat("There are", list2[[3]], list2[[1]], "in", list2[["country"]], ".")

#add an output file argument
cat("There are", list2[[3]], list2[[1]], "in",list2[["country"]],".", file = "reply.txt")


#Depending on what you called your appended lists, you should've gotten a 2x3 list matrix
#I called mine ct and created it with ct = rbind(list, list2)
#It has column headers
colnames(ct)

#And now I want to sum up the tallies of species in both countries
sum(ct$count)

# Did that work? Why or why not?
#OK, hint: it didn't return meaningful results, because our list matrix is data type of character strings; no need to panic!
#First we need to convert to a data frame
#We will use do.call(), which is handy to put together a function and list of arguments
#Our objects are already in a list so we need to only call that set of lists (ct) and we set it up
#with as.data.frame. Map() is a wrapper for a suite of 'apply' functions that we will look at next.
ct.df = do.call(rbind, Map(as.data.frame,list(ct)))

sum(ct.df$count)  #  What happened?

#To convert one atomic value to another these are handy:
#as.character(x)
#as.integer(x)
#as.logical(x)
#as.numeric(x)
#
#So we can do this anytime we want!
sum(as.numeric(ct.df$count))

###      Working directories and Datasets - Import/Export
###      Installing packages, getting down to business!
#
#setwd(), dir(), getwd(), list.files(), install.packages()
#Majority of the time you will likely be importing data already in a table
# In Windows, directory paths / need to be escaped with double//. Can copy/paste from
# Explorer address bar, then switch the slashes

getwd() # Where is the working directory?
setwd("~/Desktop/BITW-Workshop")  #In a Mac or Linux, it's easier

dir() #See what is in directory
list.files() #does same as above but may take longer

#Write out the matrix data
write.csv(mat2, "temp_mat.csv", row.names=FALSE)
dir()

#Import a CSV file
data = read.csv(file.choose())
#See a sample of the data you just read into the working space:
head(data)
colnames(data)

#Import a Excel File with {gdata}
#R's power comes from packages that extend R's functionality with libraries of functions submitted by users around the world.
#So far, we've been using the base functions that come pre-installed with R.
#Now we will install a package to read XLS files.
install.packages("gdata")
library(gdata)
??gdata
help(read.xls)
#try reading an xls file of specimen records

#For the tutorial, let's use the data downloaded from Vertnet or the xls if you have cleaned up data in this file. In this example you may have accessed to "T.rivularis.txt" (specimen data for the Red-bellied Newt, Taricha rivularis)

data = read.delim(file.choose(), sep="\t", header=T)
colnames(data)  #see column names in the header row
unique(data$scientificname)   #what is says: unique values in the ScientificName column of 'data'

# Other handy ways to quickly peek at your data:
head(data)   # First 6 rows of data frame
tail(data)      # Last 6 rows-- I like to check that no errant comma(s) or tab(s) has messed up the fields
# To check the structure of your data, use str()
str(data)



#########################
#R is a great graphing environment!
#Let's play with graphs

pie(rep(1,16),col=rainbow(16)) #rep() is a generic function that replicates value x, n times: rep(x,n)
#try changing numbers above to see what I mean
###
s <- seq(-3,3,.1) #creating sequential values between -3 and 3 at 0.1 intervals
d <- dnorm(s) #calculate standard normal density
plot(s,d,type="l")
title("Standard Normal Density",col.main="darkblue")

# Let's look at our newt data, T. rivularis:
unique(data$county)
county_Ct = table(data$county)
barplot (sort(county_Ct))

#add a few parameters:
barplot (sort(county_Ct), horiz=T, axisnames = F, col = rainbow(12), main="Counties of Red-bellied Newt Occurrences", legend = rownames(sort(county_Ct)))

#Go through ??barplots help file to see how the parameters affect your graph (or simply run one at a time)
#Note: the data itself needs a lot of cleaning up, which we will go through later.


#Lots of great examples out there and type: help(par) for further arguments to refine your graph
# We spend more time with mapping than graphing data however...

###    Loops
#Another critical skill to have in R, the ability to iterate through a set of groups, lists, objects
#One way to do this is with For Loops, which has it's pros and cons.
#Please see ForLoops_Rabosky.pdf for examples and exercises.
#
#Another way is with the suite of apply functions
??apply # To see list of functions

#Simply example with an Apply Function

mat # remember our matrix?
d <- data.frame(mat) 
d

sapply(d, mean)  #also can use lapply(); the tutorials will use Apply in various places

# Are you ready for ForLoops? Open and follow "Tues.ForLoops_R_Rabosky.pdf"
